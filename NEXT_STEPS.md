# Next Steps for Feuer Gameplay Loop Implementation

## Completed Backend Changes

We have successfully implemented the core backend functionality for the resource gathering gameplay loop:

1. ✅ Extended the Building class with:

   - Resource slots for group assignment
   - Level system with upgrades
   - Improved production based on level

2. ✅ Enhanced the Group class with:

   - Resource gathering efficiency stats
   - Building assignment tracking
   - Simplified structure by removing units and adding stats directly to groups

3. ✅ Updated the GameServer with:
   - Resource generation based on assigned groups
   - Socket handlers for group assignment/unassignment
   - Building upgrade functionality
   - Resource generation event emission
   - Group hiring system
   - Simplified battle system

## Client-Side UI Implementation

### 1. Building Info Panel

- ✅ Display building level and upgrade options
- ✅ Show resource slots and their efficiency
- ✅ Indicate which groups are assigned to which slots
- ✅ Add buttons to upgrade building (if resources available)
- ✅ Add buttons to assign/unassign groups
- ✅ Add group hiring interface

### 2. Group Info Panel

- ✅ Display gathering efficiency stats
- ✅ Show if group is assigned to a building
- ✅ Add button to unassign from current building
- ✅ Display group stats directly (simplified from units)

### 3. Resource Display

- ✅ Show resource generation rates on tiles
- ✅ Display resource collection progress
- ✅ Add visual indicators for resource generation

### 4. Socket Handlers

- ✅ Add client-side handlers for building upgrade events
- ✅ Implement handlers for group assignment/unassignment events
- ✅ Update UI when resource generation occurs
- ✅ Add handlers for group hiring events

### 5. Visual Improvements

- ✅ Add visual indicators for buildings with assigned groups
- ✅ Show building level on the map
- ✅ Indicate resource generation with animations

## Testing Plan

1. Test basic resource gathering loop:

   - Assign group to building
   - Verify resources are generated
   - Unassign group and verify production decreases

2. Test building upgrades:

   - Upgrade building and verify increased production
   - Verify additional slots become available
   - Test assignment to new slots

3. Test resource depletion:

   - Verify production decreases as resources are depleted
   - Ensure resource availability factor works correctly

4. Test group hiring system:
   - Hire different types of groups
   - Verify specialized gathering efficiencies
   - Test resource costs for hiring

## Next Immediate Steps

1. ✅ Test the implemented features thoroughly
2. ✅ Add resource generation rate visualization
3. ✅ Add building level indicators on the map
4. ✅ Implement resource collection progress visualization
5. ✅ Add animations for resource generation
6. ✅ Implement group hiring system
7. ✅ Simplify code structure by removing units

## Future Enhancements

Now that the basic resource gathering and group hiring systems are working, we can focus on:

1. ✅ Group hiring system
2. [ ] Group experience and leveling system
3. [ ] Enhanced combat mechanics
4. [ ] Morale system implementation
5. [ ] Player interaction features

## Potential Improvements

1. Add resource depletion visualization
2. Implement resource transfer between buildings
3. Add resource storage limits
4. Create specialized buildings for specific resource types
5. Implement tech tree for building upgrades
6. Add group training facilities to improve group stats
